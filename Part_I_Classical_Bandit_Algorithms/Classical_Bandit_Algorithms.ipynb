    "We consider a time-slotted bandit system $(t=1,2, \\ldots)$ with three arms. We denote the arm set as $\\{1,2,3\\}$. Pulling each arm $j(j \\in\\{1,2,3\\})$ will obtain a random reward $r_{j}$, which follows a Bernoulli distribution with mean $\\theta_{j}$, i.e., $\\operatorname{Bern}\\left(\\theta_{j}\\right)$. Specifically,\n",

Then we pull the arm $I(t)$ and obtain a random reward $r_{I(t)}$. Our objective is to find an optimal policy to choose an arm $I(t)$ in each time slot $t$ such that the expectation of the aggregated reward over $N$ time slots is maximized, i.e.,\n",
